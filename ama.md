## 1. Difference Between DOM (Document Object Model) and BOM (Browser Object Model)

The **Document Object Model (DOM)** and **Browser Object Model (BOM)** are two distinct models in web development that allow JavaScript to interact with a webpage and the browser, respectively.

### Document Object Model (DOM)

- **Definition**: The DOM is a programming interface provided by browsers that represents the structure of an HTML or XML document as a tree of objects. Each element, attribute, and piece of text in the document is represented as a node in this tree.
- **Purpose**: It allows JavaScript to dynamically access, manipulate, and update the content, structure, and style of a webpage.
- **Scope**: The DOM is specific to the document (e.g., HTML or XML) loaded in the browser.
- **Components**: Includes objects like `document`, `HTMLElement`, `Node`, and properties/methods such as `getElementById`, `querySelector`, and `innerHTML`.
- **Example**:

  ```javascript
  // Accessing and modifying an element in the DOM
  document.getElementById("myDiv").innerHTML = "Hello, DOM!";
  ```
- **Standardization**: The DOM is standardized by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).

### Browser Object Model (BOM)

- **Definition**: The BOM is a collection of objects provided by the browser to interact with the browser window and its components, such as the window, history, location, and screen.
- **Purpose**: It enables JavaScript to control browser behavior, manage windows, handle navigation, and access browser-specific features.
- **Scope**: The BOM deals with the browser environment outside the document, such as the browser's window, tabs, or URL.
- **Components**: Includes objects like `window`, `navigator`, `location`, `history`, and `screen`. Common methods include `window.alert()`, `window.open()`, and `location.href`.
- **Example**:

  ```javascript
  // Using the BOM to redirect the browser
  window.location.href = "https://example.com";
  ```
- **Standardization**: The BOM is not standardized as strictly as the DOM and varies slightly across browsers.

### Key Differences

| Aspect | DOM | BOM |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Definition** | Represents the webpage's document structure | Represents the browser window and its features |
| **Scope** | Document-specific (HTML/XML) | Browser-specific (window, history, etc.) |
| **Main Object** | `document` | `window` |
| **Standardization** | W3C standardized | Less standardized, browser-dependent |
| **Example Use** | Manipulating HTML elements | Managing browser navigation or alerts |

## 2. What is an Event in JavaScript? Explain the Different Types of Events

### Definition of an Event

An **event** in JavaScript is an action or occurrence detected by the browser, such as a user clicking a button, typing on a keyboard, or resizing a window. Events allow JavaScript to respond to user interactions or system-triggered actions.

### Types of Events

Events in JavaScript can be categorized based on their source or purpose. Below are the main types:

1. **Mouse Events**:

   - Triggered by mouse interactions.
   - Examples:
     - `click`: When a user clicks an element.
     - `dblclick`: When a user double-clicks an element.
     - `mouseover`: When the mouse pointer enters an element.
     - `mouseout`: When the mouse pointer leaves an element.
     - `mousemove`: When the mouse moves over an element.
   - Example:

     ```javascript
     document.getElementById("myButton").addEventListener("click", () => {
       alert("Button clicked!");
     });
     ```

2. **Keyboard Events**:

   - Triggered by keyboard interactions.
   - Examples:
     - `keydown`: When a key is pressed.
     - `keyup`: When a key is released.
     - `keypress`: When a key is pressed and released (deprecated in modern browsers).
   - Example:

     ```javascript
     document.addEventListener("keydown", (event) => {
       console.log(`Key pressed: ${event.key}`);
     });
     ```

3. **Form Events**:

   - Related to form interactions.
   - Examples:
     - `submit`: When a form is submitted.
     - `change`: When an input element’s value changes.
     - `focus`: When an element gains focus.
     - `blur`: When an element loses focus.
   - Example:

     ```javascript
     document.getElementById("myForm").addEventListener("submit", (event) => {
       event.preventDefault();
       console.log("Form submitted!");
     });
     ```

4. **Window Events**:

   - Triggered by browser window actions.
   - Examples:
     - `load`: When a page or resource finishes loading.
     - `resize`: When the browser window is resized.
     - `scroll`: When the user scrolls the page.
   - Example:

     ```javascript
     window.addEventListener("resize", () => {
       console.log("Window resized!");
     });
     ```

5. **Touch Events** (for touch-enabled devices):

   - Triggered by touch interactions.
   - Examples:
     - `touchstart`: When a touch point is placed on the screen.
     - `touchmove`: When a touch point moves across the screen.
     - `touchend`: When a touch point is removed.
   - Example:

     ```javascript
     document.addEventListener("touchstart", () => {
       console.log("Touch detected!");
     });
     ```

6. **Drag and Drop Events**:

   - Related to dragging and dropping elements.
   - Examples:
     - `dragstart`: When dragging begins.
     - `dragover`: When an element is dragged over a drop target.
     - `drop`: When an element is dropped.
   - Example:

     ```javascript
     document.getElementById("draggable").addEventListener("dragstart", () => {
       console.log("Dragging started!");
     });
     ```

## 3. What are Event Listeners in JavaScript?

### Definition

An **event listener** in JavaScript is a function that waits for a specific event to occur on a specified element and executes a callback function when that event is triggered. Event listeners enable dynamic and interactive web applications by responding to user or system actions.

### How Event Listeners Work

- Event listeners are attached to DOM elements using the `addEventListener` method.
- Syntax:

  ```javascript
  element.addEventListener(event, callback, [options]);
  ```
  - `event`: The type of event (e.g., `"click"`, `"keydown"`).
  - `callback`: The function to execute when the event occurs.
  - `options` (optional): Settings like `{ once: true }` (run once) or `{ capture: true }` (use event capturing).

### Example

```javascript
document.getElementById("myButton").addEventListener("click", () => {
  console.log("Button was clicked!");
});
```

### Key Points

- **Multiple Listeners**: You can attach multiple event listeners to the same element for the same or different events.
- **Removing Listeners**: Use `removeEventListener` to detach a listener, but the callback must be a named function (not anonymous).

  ```javascript
  function handleClick() {
    console.log("Clicked!");
  }
  document.getElementById("myButton").addEventListener("click", handleClick);
  document.getElementById("myButton").removeEventListener("click", handleClick);
  ```
- **Event Object**: The callback receives an event object with details about the event (e.g., `event.target`, `event.key`).

## 4. What is an API? Explain with an Example

### Definition

An **API (Application Programming Interface)** is a set of rules and tools that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. In web development, APIs enable JavaScript to interact with external services, such as fetching data from a server or integrating third-party functionality.

### Key Characteristics

- APIs act as intermediaries, allowing applications to request and exchange data or perform actions.
- Web APIs are typically accessed via HTTP requests (e.g., GET, POST) and return data in formats like JSON or XML.
- Common web APIs include the Fetch API, REST APIs, and third-party APIs (e.g., Twitter API, Google Maps API).

### Example

Using the **Fetch API** to retrieve data from a public API (e.g., JSONPlaceholder):

```javascript
fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1")
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => {
    console.log("Title:", data.title);
    console.log("Body:", data.body);
  })
  .catch((error) => console.error("Error:", error));
```

**Explanation**:

- The `fetch` function sends a GET request to the specified URL.
- The response is converted to JSON using `response.json()`.
- The data (e.g., a blog post’s title and body) is logged to the console.
- If an error occurs (e.g., network failure), it’s caught and logged.

### Real-World Use Case

APIs are used to fetch weather data, display maps, integrate payment gateways, or post tweets programmatically.

## 5. Explain Event Bubbling and Event Capturing in JavaScript

### Event Bubbling

- **Definition**: Event bubbling is the default behavior in which an event triggered on a nested element propagates upward through its parent elements in the DOM tree.
- **Order**: From the innermost element (target) to the outermost (e.g., `document`).
- **Example**:

  ```html
  <div id="parent">
    <button id="child">Click me</button>
  </div>
  ```

  ```javascript
  document.getElementById("parent").addEventListener("click", () => {
    console.log("Parent clicked!");
  });
  document.getElementById("child").addEventListener("click", () => {
    console.log("Child clicked!");
  });
  ```
  - Clicking the button logs: `Child clicked!` followed by `Parent clicked!` because the event bubbles up from the button to the parent `div`.

### Event Capturing (Trickling)

- **Definition**: Event capturing is the opposite of bubbling, where the event starts at the outermost element (e.g., `document`) and propagates downward to the target element.
- **Order**: From the outermost element to the innermost (target).
- **How to Enable**: Set the `useCapture` parameter in `addEventListener` to `true`.

  ```javascript
  document.getElementById("parent").addEventListener("click", () => {
    console.log("Parent clicked!");
  }, true);
  document.getElementById("child").addEventListener("click", () => {
    console.log("Child clicked!");
  }, true);
  ```
  - Clicking the button logs: `Parent clicked!` followed by `Child clicked!` because the event is captured from the outer element first.

### Key Points

- **Default Behavior**: Bubbling is the default; capturing must be explicitly enabled.
- **Stopping Propagation**: Use `event.stopPropagation()` to prevent an event from bubbling or capturing further.

  ```javascript
  document.getElementById("child").addEventListener("click", (event) => {
    console.log("Child clicked!");
    event.stopPropagation(); // Prevents parent from receiving the event
  });
  ```
- **Event Phases**: Events have three phases: capturing (1), target (2), and bubbling (3).

## 6. What is Event Delegation in JavaScript?

### Definition

**Event delegation** is a technique in JavaScript where a single event listener is attached to a parent element to handle events triggered by its child elements, leveraging event bubbling. This is efficient for dynamic content or large numbers of elements.

### How It Works

- Instead of adding event listeners to each child element, you add one listener to a parent.
- When an event occurs on a child, it bubbles up to the parent, where the listener checks the `event.target` to determine which child triggered the event.

### Example

```html
<ul id="list">
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
  <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>
```

```javascript
document.getElementById("list").addEventListener("click", (event) => {
  if (event.target.tagName === "LI") {
    console.log(`Clicked: ${event.target.textContent}`);
  }
});
```

- Clicking any `<li>` logs its text (e.g., `Clicked: Item 1`), even if new `<li>` elements are added dynamically.

### Advantages

- **Efficiency**: Reduces the number of event listeners, improving performance.
- **Dynamic Elements**: Automatically handles events for elements added to the DOM after the listener is attached.
- **Memory Savings**: Avoids attaching listeners to each child element.

### Use Cases

- Handling clicks on a list of items (e.g., todo list, menu).
- Managing events for dynamically generated elements (e.g., buttons created via JavaScript).

### Considerations

- Check `event.target` to ensure the correct element is targeted.
- Use `event.stopPropagation()` if you want to prevent further bubbling.
- For complex DOM structures, use methods like `event.target.closest()` to find specific ancestors.
